						“Every cause needs a champion, a hero to rally otherwise common men to a righteous cause and lead them to victory. The Crusader is that champion. With holy blade in hand he smites the wicked and sends them back to the darkness from whence they crept. While his armor restricts his movement it affords him great protection, allowing him to stand in the frontlines to take the blows that his weaker comrades cannot.
<br><br> 
No matter the pressures he faces he will remain strong, finding strength within himself to keep fighting on while inspiring others to do the same. Even in the midst of battle he can galvanize his allies, giving them the strength to fight off madness for a little longer. When the Crusader is leading the charge, all of hell will know to fear the flame.„

						“Knowledge - the poison of man. Since time began, it has been the folly of men such as the Ancestor. Many have sought it out, but those who discover the truth of this world's secrets have found the revelations too much to bear. The Occultist, however, has utilized that same knowledge to further his understanding of the eldritch. His pursuits in antediluvian apprehension have left his body fragile and weak, but it has made his mind sharp and his capabilities most versatile. From the back, he can channel his baleful energy to strike those hiding in the shadows or pull them forward, removing all filth from his presence. With his curses, he can expel a foe's strength or open them up for devastation. His eldritch powers can rend the souls of even the most foul of beasts leaving them motionless, but at the cost of calling the ever-looming shadows closer. 
<br><br>
While mostly destructive, the Occultist can also use his profane powers to reconstruct flesh and heal wounds. This technique is powerful, but unpredictable as it may restore a man to perfect health or tear apart their flesh. At camp, he practices rituals and rites that can empower his allies and even bring them back from the brink of death, but many of these eccentric practices can leave both the Occultist and his companions troubled. The gate to hell is open, and this man will seal it away with the very power it gave him.„

						“A lifetime of scholarly inquest into ancient and forbidden lore has opened the Occultist's mind to the powers of the void. Debilitating curses and maddeningly impossible support skills are his specialty. The void, however, is an unpredictable power, and consequently skills' effectiveness can vary dramatically, and usually come at a cost of light, or stress.„ ~ The Guild

						“A bandit seeking redemption on an old road, the Highwayman is one of the fastest classes in the game and is able to dish out a lot of damage quickly. He can be placed in both the front ranks and rend enemies with his short sword, or he can pursue enemies from the back with his trusty pistol. He has a lower HP value than most classes, but makes up for this with high evasion.
<br><br>
When night falls and all of his allies are settled around a campfire, the Highwayman is preparing for what dangers await. He'll spend his time performing maintenance on his weaponry, practicing his blade-work or setting up alarms to keep himself safe during the night. If he must interact with others it'll be with his dark sense of humor, which might upset some. But for what the Highwayman lacks in tact he makes up in unparalleled finesse. With a flintlock in one hand and a dirk in the other, the Highwayman is sure to make short work of his foes.„
